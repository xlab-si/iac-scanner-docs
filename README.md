## Purpose and description
This project documents all the related IaC Scanner tools and services.
The documentation is available on [GitHub Pages].

## Run with Docker
You can run the docs using a public [xscanner/docs] Docker image as follows:

```console
# run IaC Scanner documentation in a Docker container and navigate to localhost:8000
$ docker run --name iac-scanner-docs -p 8000:80 xscanner/docs
```

Or you can build the image locally and run it as follows:

```console
# build Docker container
$ docker build -t iac-scanner-docs .
# run IaC Scanner documentation in a Docker container and navigate to localhost:8000
$ docker run --name iac-scanner-docs -p 8000:80 iac-scanner-docs
```

## Local building and testing
For documenting the IaC Scanner we use the [Sphinx documentation tool].
Here we can render Sphinx Documentation from RST files and we use [Read the Docs] theme.

To test the documentation locally run the commands below:

```console
# create and activate a new Python virualenv
$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
# update pip and install Sphinx requirements
(.venv) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
# build the HTML documentation
(.venv) $ sphinx-build -M html docs build
# build the Latex and PDF documentation
(.venv) $ sphinx-build -M latexpdf docs build
```

After that you will found rendered documentation HTML files in `build` folder and you can open and view them inside 
your browser.
